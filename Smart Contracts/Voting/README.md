- Retrieve the total votes for each candidate.
- Events emitted on votes for easy tracking.

## Technologies
- Solidity ^0.8.29

## Contract Files
- `Voting.sol` â€” main smart contract file

## How to Deploy
1. Compile with Solidity compiler version 0.8.29.
2. Deploy without constructor parameters.

## Usage
- Call `addCandidate(string)` to add candidates.
- Call `vote(uint)` to cast a vote for a candidate.
- Use `getVotes(uint)` to view votes for a candidate.
- Check voting status with `hasVoted` mapping.
